# Welcome to SCH!

The Science Coffee House, IIT Kanpur is a hobby group where we share and discuss scientific ideas and views, and host a variety of content and events. SCH was established in 2011 by a group of enthusiastic people who used to gather together in the KD lounge and discuss their ideas. The group has gradually grown in size and activity as every year new passionate people keep joining.


### What do we do?
SCH hosts various articles, puzzles and exciting talks and discussions. We host articles and news from diverse fields which you can read and enjoy with a cup of coffee. The puzzles, which we call Brain Stimulants require a bit more thought and careful investigation. The talks organized by SCH are the perfect places to learn and explore something new. These talks, given by students for students, is a remarkable opportunity for students to both learn from their peers and to take the stage.
