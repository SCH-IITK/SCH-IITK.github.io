<!-- # Observing the strange Quantum World using Double Slit -->

For us living in a classical world, particles and waves form different pictures in our mind. Particles have mass and a well-defined position whereas waves are carriers of energy and are delocalized. Two waves on meeting don't bounce off like particles instead, these interfere with each other. However, these distinctions seem to break down as we peek into the world at quantum scale. It has been observed that light and matter has properties of both particles and waves but both these properties cannot be observed simultaneously. This is known as the complementarity principle. In this article, we will try to understand the various experiments done by scientists to observe this dual nature of light simultaneously and the shocking results they got.

## Interference and Entanglement

In a single photon double-slit experiment, photons are emitted one at a time, from a low intensity source, towards the two slits. These single photons after passing through the slits are detected on a phosphorescent screen. Gradually, an interference pattern emerges on screen.

According to Quantum Mechanics, the state
$$ \vert  \Psi  \rangle $$
of these photons exiting the double slit can be represented as superposition of
$$ \vert  \psi_{1} \left( \vec{r} \right) \rangle $$
and
$$\vert  \psi_{2} \left( \vec{r} \right) \rangle $$
:

$$
\vert  \Psi  \rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \times  \left[ \vert  \psi _{1} \left( \vec{r} \right)  \rangle + \vert  \psi _{2} \left( \vec{r} \right)  \rangle  \right]
$$

where
$$   \vert  \psi _{1} \left( \vec{r} \right)  \rangle  $$
and
$$ \vert  \psi_{2} \left( \vec{r} \right)  \rangle  $$
represent the possibility for the particles to take path 1 or 2, respectively. The probability distribution for one-particle detection at a point
$$  \vec{r} $$
is given by
$$  \vert\langle\vec{r} \vert  \Psi  \rangle  \vert ^{2} $$
; the cross terms
$$\langle \psi _{1} \left( \vec{r} \right)  \vert \vec{r} \rangle\langle\vec{r \vert } \psi _{2} \left( \vec{r} \right)  \rangle  $$
and
$$\langle \psi _{2} \left( \vec{r} \right)  \vert \vec{r} \rangle\langle\vec{r \vert } \psi _{1} \left( \vec{r} \right)  \rangle  $$
are responsible for interference.

Now you might get curious and ask, which slit does each of the photons go through?

To find this **‘Which-Way’** information, we use pairs of photons which are entangled.
Entanglement is a phenomena by which quantum states of two photons are dependent on each other.
Entangled photons can be created by a process called spontaneous parametric down conversion. A beta-barium borate (BBO) crystal is used to create two high wavelength entangled photons from a low wavelength photon such that their polarization(direction in which electric field of light is oscillating) are correlated through orthogonality(x and y polarized).
The state(called Bell state) of these entangled photons is described as :

$$
\vert  \Psi  \rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \times  \left(  \vert x \rangle _{s} \vert y \rangle _{p}+ \vert y \rangle _{s} \vert x \rangle _{p} \right) 
$$

where the indices *s* and *p* indicate the two paths along which the entangled pair created by BBO move.
Entangled state means if *s* photon is measured to be polarized in x direction(
$$   \vert x \rangle _{s} $$
in Dirac notation),then it is known with certainty that the other *p* photon has y polarization(
$$   \vert y \rangle _{p} $$
).

## Double Slit experiment

<div class="cap">Fig.1-Expeimental setup to create entangled photons and observe interference.</div>

In this experimental setup,the two photons of the entangled pair go off in different *s* and *p* directions, therefore referred as *s* photon and *p* photon respectively.The s photons are the ones that create the interference pattern.When both detectors Ds and Dp detect the photon pair,the count is recorded(coincidence count).The counts are tallied for 400 seconds and then the Ds is moved by one millimeter.

## Which-Way Information

![Fig.3-Experimental setup to collect which-way information.](./blogs/4/Fig-3.png)
<div class="cap">Fig.3-Experimental setup to collect which-way information.</div>

Now, for which way marker a quarter wave plate(QWP) is put in front of each slit .QWP changes linearly polarized light into light with circular polarization. QWP 1 and QWP2 are set in such a way that y polarized photons are right circularly polarized(R) by QWP1 while left circularly polarized(L) by QWP2 and visa-versa for x polarized photons.
In this way information of which slit the s photon went through can be obtained as shown in the table.

But now as this information can be obtained, the experiment performed no longer produces interference!

<div class="cap">Fig.4-Destruction of interference due to which-way information.</div>

One can't help but ask, how do these photons know that we could know which slit they went through.
You might be suspicious that the polarization caused by QWPs has caused the interference to disappear but you will notice in the next part of the article that this is not the case. Surprisingly, the interference can be brought back without removing the QWPs or doing anything to the *s* photons

## Quantum Eraser experiment

![Fig.5-Experimental setup to erase which-way information.](./blogs/4/Fig-5.png)
<div class="cap">vFig.5-Experimental setup to erase which-way information.</div>

This image shows the modified setup to perform quantum eraser experiment. A polarizer(POL1) is placed in front of *p* photons so that it passes a combination of *x* and *y* polarized photons. Now we cannot determine the linear polarization of *s* photons and therefore which-way information is erased. The coincidence counts are taken using detectors and it can be seen from the data that the interference pattern is back!

![Fig.6-Interference restored due to presence of polarizer(POL1).](./blogs/4/Fig-6.png)
<div class="cap">Fig.6-Interference restored due to presence of polarizer(POL1).</div>

But, how does *s* photons know that we have put a polarizer in front of p photons?
One might think as photon *s* and photon *p* are entangled. Photon *p* must be able to communicate to *s* through some means that is unknown to us. It must be telling *s* whether it should be producing a pattern or not.  But as we will see, this does not seem to be the case.  In the next section, things get even more stranger.

## Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment

In this last and final part of experiment, the polarizer POL1 and detector Dp for *p* photon are moved farther away from BBO crystal, so that *s* photon is detected first at detector Ds before photon *p* encounters the polarizer. On performing the experiment, *s* photons still form an interference pattern.
![Fig.7-Interference still observed despite changing the order of detection of s and p photons.](./blogs/4/Fig-7.png)
<div class="cap">Fig.7-Interference still observed despite changing the order of detection of *s* and *p* photons.</div>

This is weird. It seems that passing of *p* photon through polarizer in the future, leading to destruction of which way information, has affected the behavior of *s* photon in the past. This is known as retro causality.

## Conclusions

* There is no instantaneous transfer of information between *s* and *p* photons because the interference pattern is observed using coincidence counts data which is collected using both detectors. We cannot observe interference only by detecting s photons as it will also contain noise.
* Scientific community avoid the explanation of the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment based on retro causality as it would lead to violation of different sorts of laws in physics. Instead, they claim that the behavior of *s* photon at Ds determines the fate of *p* photon at polarizer i.e. whether or not to pass through the polarizer and get detected by Dp.
* It seems that these entangled photons also have some sort of entangled connection with the quarter wave plates and the polarizer. And the presence or absence of polarizer changes this entanglement and therefore the results.

Science Coffee House IITK leaves you now with a few words from Richard Feynman on Double-Slit experiment:
“We choose to examine a phenomenon which is impossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality, it contains the only mystery.”
