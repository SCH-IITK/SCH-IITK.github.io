Hey science lovers! This is one of the two projects that we did in Summer'20.

It is almost perplexing how much one can buildup from Newtonâ€™s Laws using only mathematically rigorous tools such as topology, Lie algebra, and much more. We use these tools to develop the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation to simplify the problems which would be a menace if we were to solve them using just Newton's equations! We used these formulations to obtain an elegant solution to the Heavy Symmetric Top.

For more details, you can refer to the poster and also the articles penned down by the project members!
