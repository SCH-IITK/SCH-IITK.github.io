SCH is lauching a reading group project where we will go through the course [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall20/). The course is instructed by Alan Edelman, David P. Sanders, Grant Sanderson(3B1B), James Schloss and Benoit Forget.

### Course Description
This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking. We use the Julia programming language to approach real-world problems in varied areas applying data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling. In this class you will learn computer science, software, algorithms, applications, and mathematics as an integrated whole. Topics include: Image analysis, Particle dynamics and ray tracing, Epidemic propagation, Climate modeling.

 The project will commence on 26th December. If you would like to be a part of the project join the computational-thinking discord channel on the SCH Discord server.
